## Thoughts on the future of the European Union

This is a subjective analysis and by no means represents certain future. However, one reason why the European Union could face difficulty in the future might be due to economic disparities amongst the member nations. Weaker economies might struggle to keep up with the fiscal and monetary standards maintained by stronger economies. Further, the European Union, being a collective of diverse nations, faces significant cultural differences. This means a spectrum of different languages, traditions, social norms, and historical backgrounds, which under certain circumstances, might lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding. Some member nations also hold strong national identities which sometimes cause friction with the supranational identity promoted by the EU. Such cultural and identity differences can lead to disagreements when it comes to decision making on EU wide policies. This, coupled with the economic disparities mentioned and the complexities of managing multilateral agreements, could potentially lead to tensions or conflicts. Again, this is a hypothetical scenario and doesn't certainly predicate the collapse of the European Union.
