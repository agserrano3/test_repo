## Preparation

- Preparation in 12 simple steps:
- Heat the oil over a low flame in the paella pan (wide and shallow receptacle).
- Next, sauté the chicken and rabbit for around 5 minutes.
- Then add the freshly chopped vegetables, beans, artichokes and grated tomato to the pan. Fry for several minutes until a smooth sauté begins to form.
- Add the paprika and fry over a low flame for one minute after adding the water.
- Next, add the saffron, garrofon beans and salt to taste.
- Turn up the heat and leave to boil for approximately 15 minutes.
- Add the snails, should you be including them in the recipe.
- Then spread the rice evenly across the pan.
- Leave to boil for a further 15 minutes and then test the stock. Add salt if necessary.
- During the last 7-8 minutes add the rosemary. Leave it to cook for around 5 minutes before removing it from the pan.
- The paella is cooked when the liquid has evaporated but the mixture is not completely dry.
- In order to achieve the famous socarrat, the crispy caramelised bottom, leave it to cook a little longer over a low flame.
- Let it rest for 5 min and then serve
